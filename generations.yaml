Powertrain options included small displacement turbocharged gasoline and diesel engines, with a focus on efficiency and emissions compliance for European regulations. The interior offered class-competitive technology including NissanConnect infotainment system, Around View Monitor, and various driver assistance features. This generation was positioned as a conventional compact hatchback competitor to the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus, but achieved limited commercial success in the highly competitive European C-segment, leading to its discontinuation after a relatively short production run."
